Computational detection of microRNA candidates.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been characterized as an important regulators 
in almost all animals and plants, as well as in unicellular eukaryotes :cite:`Moran:17`. 
Since their discovery in 1993 :cite:`Lee1993` and subsequently in their recognition as 
a biological entity later from 2000 :cite:`Reinhart2000`, microRNAs were identified 
as key regulators on the temporal control of heterochronic genes on the nematode 
*Caenorhabditis elegans* and subsequently in another metazoan species :cite:`Pasquinelli:00`. 
This recognition were complemented by a complete characterization of their 
typical features as: a stem-loop structure, well-conservation over multiple metazoan clades
and typical expression patterns as an isolated locus or co-expression of polycistronic miRNA
transcripts :cite:`Lagos-Quintana:2001,Lau:2001,Lee:2001,Reinhart2000`.

Now, metazoan miRNAs have been recognized as a conserved group of short ncRNAs, 
typically ~ 22 nt, with important roles as post-transcriptional regulators of the gene expression 
affecting a sizeable number of mRNAs and expressed in all developmental
process and diseases :cite:`Bartel:18`. Their canonical biogenesis starts in the form of primary
precursors (pri-miRNAs) transcribed from long non-coding RNAs or protein-coding transcripts,
mostly from introns :cite:`Zeidler:2020`. Later, derived from hairpin-like precursors excised in 
the nucleus (pre-miRNAs), their acting form is subsequently further processed as 
miRNA/miRNA* duplexes on the cytoplasm and incorporated into the RISC complex.
Target specificity is achieved by complementarity between the miR and mRNA sequence.
(see more details in :cite:`Bartel:18`).

Current classification of annotated miRNAs into families are available in miRBase [#f1]_ and
mirGeneDB [#f2]_ databases. As an example, the human genome reported 1984 miRNA precursors in 
the miRBase v.22.1 :cite:`Kozomara:19` and the corresponding mature products were estimated ~2300
:cite:`Alles:19`. Focusing on the *confidently canonical* miRNAs reported in :cite:`Fromm:15`,
the number of miRNAs is 519. Those differences are explained on the basis of multiple 
*miRNA* detection methods as well as the intrinsic definitions to define a *canonical miRNA*.

Despite
The computational detection of miRNA precursors is possible despite their small sizes, 
due the often extreme level of sequence conservation (cite).


In this computational approach we focus on the *canonical* miRNAs processed by Drosha and Dicer, with a set of common features defined by :cite:`Tarver:12`.

``miRNAture`` is used to annotate homologs of metazoan microRNAs, discovered by means of
sequence, structural validation and correct position of their *mature* sequences,
detected on a harboring-hairpin-loop structure. This computational strategy enables 
an automated annotation workflow to search *bona fide* miRNA candidates, based
on pairwise comparisons and hidden Markov profiles, at sequence level. The
secondary structure is evaluated using covariance models and evaluating the
correct folding of the hairpin sequences, based on the position of the *mature*
sequences. 

Strategy
^^^^^^^^
Current approaches to computational miRNA detection relies on homology relationships 
or detection of hairpin-loop candidates with lower folding energy. A complete set of 
tools to automatize this task have been assembled on ``miRNAture``. This current 
approach combines two different sequence-homology modes, using ``blast`` or ``HMMer``, and 
a secondary structure validation step, performed by the ``INFERNAL`` package. Combination 
of different strategies and the modification of default covariance models, let ``miRNAture``
report not only the homology relationships, but also define positions of *mature* sequences 
and the correct miRNA annotation, supported by multiple family specific alignments.
Current workflow is depicted as follows:

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download the source code or clone the miRNAture project located on Github_.
On the ``Code/`` folder execute the file:: 

    ./activate_environment_conda.sh

Which will create the ``miRNAture`` conda repository (based on the
``miRNAture.yml`` file) and will install all the required programs to run
``miRNAture``.
