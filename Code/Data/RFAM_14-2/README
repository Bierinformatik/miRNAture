# The source of this data was the miRNAs from those models that reported
# at least one sequence from Metazoan species. Those ones are located on
# the CM/All/ folder. The CMs used on the study are located on 
# CM/miRNANoLatimeria.
# The origin of this data is the folder:
# /scr/k70san/bogota_unal/miRNAturePaper/Data/RFAM_14-2 # For the default ones
# and
#/scr/k70san/bogota_unal/miRNAturePaper/Data/RFAM_14-2_MODELS_THIS_STUDY  # For the modified ones.
