Current approaches to computational miRNA detection relies on homology relationships 
or detection of hairpin-loop candidates with lower folding energy. A complete set of 
tools to automatize this task have been assembled on ``miRNAture``. This current 
approach combines two different sequence-homology modes, using ``blast`` or ``HMMer``, and 
a secondary structure validation step, performed by the ``INFERNAL`` package. Current workflow 
is depicted as follows:
